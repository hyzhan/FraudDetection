# FraudDetection
Examples and Tutorials related to fraud detection using machine learning and deep learning. 

### CreditCardFraud_Detection

A beginner tutorial consisting of 3 parts show how to build a classifier with TensorFlow to 
detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
We see how to develop a logisitic regression from scratch 
and extend it to a simple deep feed-forward network using  TensorFlow's low-level api.
At the end the tutorial gives an outlook on Keras.

### Anomaly_Detection_with_RNN

This tutorial shows how to use using PyTorch to build a LSTM network with embeddings which 
can learn user profiles and detect anomalies in user activities. It's an
example for using deep learning to detect anomalies. 
This method is a unsupervised learning tasks. And dosn't rely on
prelabeled data.

These kind of method could be for example used to detect data theft from application 
logs or detect online shopping fraud.
